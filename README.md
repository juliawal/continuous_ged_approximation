In this repository the performance of the GED heuristic BRANCH using the extended Sinkhorn algorithm is being compared to BRANCH using the Hungarian algorithm on real-world GED instances created from the datasets Acyclic, MAO and RNA_trees.
The code is based on the work of Benoit Gaüzère and Luc Brun on the extended Sinkhorn algorithm. In the folder 'deepged' one can find parts of their code that have been used. Also parts of the python package graphkit_learn by Linlin Jia, Benoit Gaüzère and Paul Honeine have been used and are found in 'graphkit_learn'.
